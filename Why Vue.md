# Why Vue
***

When Looking for a good front-end framework to use for my application I immediately stumbled upon the three biggest Frameworks, namely Vue, Angular and React. And whilst I could have also chosen Angular or react for my project I ended up using Vue for a couple of reasons.

**Firstly**, Vue.js has a relatively simple syntax that is easy to learn and understand. As a newcomer to web development, this is especially appealing as it minimizes the amount of time spent learning complex concepts and syntax.

**Secondly**, Vue.js is a lightweight framework, meaning it doesn't require a lot of setup or infrastructure to get started. This allows me to focus on building my application without worrying about extensive setup or configuration.

**Third**, Vue.js offers exceptional flexibility, allowing it to be integrated seamlessly into existing projects or to be utilized to develop standalone web applications.

**Fourth**, Vue.js is highly performant, capable of managing large amounts of data and complex user interfaces without impacting system performance. Its implementation of a virtual DOM, similar to React, facilitates efficient updates to the user interface.

**Finally**, while Vue.js may not have the scale of community support of Angular or React, it has a passionate and dedicated community of developers who actively contribute to its development and support its growth.

In conclusion, as a newcomer to web development, Vue.js offers a friendly and accessible option that is easy to learn and offers flexibility for my project. While there are other viable options, Vue.js stands out as the best fit for my needs.
