# Requirements and design
***
*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.*

## Individual project

As the sole developer and stakeholder of my project, I had the advantage of easily creating user stories and tasks that perfectly aligned with my vision. I also took the time to create a wireframe of the website's core design, focusing on simplicity and making it visually appealing. I strongly believe that a visually pleasing website contributes to an improved user experience.

In addition to design considerations, I dedicated effort to the architectural aspects of my project. I immersed myself in the intricacies of architectural designs, meticulously crafting a strong and scalable structure. To validate my designs, I employed a variety of testing techniques.

For instance, I utilized UI testing to ensure that the user interface was responsive and user-friendly. This helped me identify and address any usability issues early on. Moreover, I conducted functional testing to guarantee that the core functionalities of my application worked seamlessly.
