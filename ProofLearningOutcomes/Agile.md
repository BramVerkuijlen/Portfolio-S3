# Agile
***
*You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.*

## What is Agile?
***

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It stands out for its emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. 
By breaking projects into smaller units called sprints or iterations, teams work together to deliver the product.
Agile methodologies foster close collaboration, transparent communication, and frequent meetings to track progress and address any challenges that arise. Notably, 
Agile embraces change and adjusts plans based on feedback and evolving requirements, allowing for a fluid and responsive development process.

## Scrum
***

For my recent project, I adopted the Scrum framework to manage the development process.
I divided the project into manageable sprints lasting two weeks each. At the conclusion of every sprint, I did a [retrospective](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S3/tree/main/Sprint%20Review) using ChatGTP and a [sprint review](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S3/blob/main/Sprint%20Review/Sprint%20Reviews.md).
These sessions allowed me to reflect on my progress, identify areas for improvement, and make any necessary adjustments for future sprints.
The retrospectives and sprint reviews played a vital role in fostering a culture of continuous learning and ensuring that my project remained on track.

## Jira
***

To support my Agile practices, I used Jira as a project management tool. Jira provided a robust platform for managing my sprints and user stories. One of the key advantages was the ability to automate certain tasks, such as adding a 'Definition of Done' subtask to every user story. This automation streamlined my workflow, ensuring that each user story had clear and consistent criteria for completion. Jira's user-friendly interface allowed me to easily track progress, update task statuses, and collaborate with my team. Overall, Jira played a crucial role in enhancing my Agile experience, enabling efficient sprint management and maintaining a well-structured workflow.

## User stories and Backlog

In my project, I embraced the use of user stories as a means to define requirements and guide the development process. Initially, I encountered some challenges as I had created user stories that were too large and difficult to complete within a single sprint.

However, in my second iteration, I adjusted my approach and broke down the user stories into smaller, more manageable pieces. To streamline my workflow, I further subdivided these user stories into specific subtasks, which made it easier to track progress and allocate work. This shift allowed for a more efficient and effective development process, ensuring that I could deliver incremental value with each sprint while maintaining a clear focus on the project goals.

I also utilized a backlog to prioritize and manage user stories for future sprints. The backlog served as a centralized repository where I ordered the user stories based on their importance, from the most critical to the least. This allowed me to focus on delivering high-value features first and maintain alignment with the project goals.

## CI CD

In my project, I successfully incorporated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices. CI/CD allowed me to achieve frequent integration of code changes and automated testing, ensuring a reliable and efficient delivery process. By implementing CI/CD pipelines, I could quickly and reliably deploy new features and updates to production environments. These practices enabled faster feedback, reduced the risk of integration issues, and supported the continuous delivery of valuable software increments.
