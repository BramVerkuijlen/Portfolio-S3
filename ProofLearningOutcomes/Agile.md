## What is Agile?
***

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It stands out for its emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. 
By breaking projects into smaller units called sprints or iterations, teams work together to deliver the product.
Agile methodologies foster close collaboration, transparent communication, and frequent meetings to track progress and address any challenges that arise. Notably, 
Agile embraces change and adjusts plans based on feedback and evolving requirements, allowing for a fluid and responsive development process.
