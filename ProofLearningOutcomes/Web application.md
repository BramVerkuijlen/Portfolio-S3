# Web application
***
*You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.*


## User friendly
***
*You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques.*


I created a user-friendly web application by prioritizing a simplistic and appealing design. My main focus was on creating a clean and intuitive user interface to ensure that users could easily navigate and interact with the app.

To enhance the quality of my application, I used peer feedback throughout the development process. By asking my peers for feedback, I was able to gather insights and perspectives, allowing me to refine the user interface and overall user experience.

I made several adjustments to the front-end based on the suggestions provided by my peers. This iterative process helped me address any usability issues and implement changes that enhanced the app's usability and visual appeal.

## Full-stack
***
*You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communication issues.*

During my individual project, I successfully developed a full stack web application by employing Vue 3 with TypeScript for the front end and JavaScript with a wrapper to utilize the IGDB API for the back end. After conducting thorough research, I determined that Vue 3, coupled with TypeScript, would provide a robust and efficient framework for creating the user interface of my application. By leveraging Vue's component-based architecture and TypeScript's static typing, I was able to ensure a reliable and scalable front-end solution.

For the back end of my application, I opted to use JavaScript and employed a wrapper to interact with the IGDB API. This allowed me to access and integrate a wide range of game-related information seamlessly. By utilizing JavaScript on the server side, I ensured compatibility and smooth communication between the front-end components and the API.

Although I inherently didn't use an ORM because it wasn't necessary for my project's specific requirements and functionality, I did make an example project for storing a Twitch acess key that you can find [here](https://github.com/Phantom-works/Adviser-Example-TwitchKeyAPI).

As part of my individual project, I conducted research on implementing an API gateway to enhance the application's architecture. However, due to time constraints, I could not fully implement the API gateway within the project scope. Nevertheless, the research provided valuable insights into its potential advantages for future projects, such as improved security and scalability.
