## Individual project

Throughout my individual project, I demonstrated a strong sense of professionalism and dedication. I conducted extensive research, seeking to establish a solid foundation and deepen my understanding of the subject matter. Valuing diverse perspectives, I actively sought feedback from both peers and my teacher, incorporating their insights to enhance my work. I made a concerted effort to implement best practices, leveraging the knowledge and skills I had acquired. Rigorous testing ensured the reliability and functionality of my project, while documenting my progress on GitHub showcased my commitment and proficiency.

## Group project

In the group project, professionalism remained a guiding principle. We prioritized clear and effective communication, fostering understanding and alignment among team members. Actively engaging with stakeholders, we valued their input and worked collaboratively to meet their expectations. Utilizing a Jira board, we organized tasks and user stories, streamlining our workflow and promoting transparency and accountability. Our collective professionalism and effective use of collaboration tools contributed to the successful execution of the project, delivering a cohesive and satisfying outcome.
