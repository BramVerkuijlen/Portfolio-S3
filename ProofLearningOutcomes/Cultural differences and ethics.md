# Cultural differences and ethics
***
*You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.*

## Cultural differences

Please note that I have worked alone on this particular project, and as a result, I cannot provide direct proof of cultural differences in this specific context.
However, I encourage you to explore our group project [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md).

## Code ethics
***
In my project, which caters to gamers who struggle with choosing their next game to play, I adhere to the code ethics established by the [Association for Computing Machiner](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) (ACM). Central to these ethics is the principle of ensuring that my project does not replace any job positions. I firmly believe that my project is meant to complement the gaming experience by providing recommendations and guidance, rather than eliminating the need for human involvement in the industry.

To deliver accurate and informed game recommendations, I integrated the IGDB API into my project. This API serves as a reliable source of data, allowing me to access comprehensive information about a vast array of games. By leveraging this API, I ensure that my project can provide well-informed suggestions to gamers, taking into account their preferences, genres, and other relevant factors.

You can also find the proof for our group code ethics [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md).
