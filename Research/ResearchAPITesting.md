## Introduction
***

or my individual project, I have designed an API that offers a convenient and user-friendly method to search for games based on specific categories. By utilizing the IGDB (Internet Game Database) API, users can request games that belong to various genres, platforms, or themes. The API acts as an intermediary, facilitating interaction with the IGDB API to retrieve pertinent game data. Additionally, the API obtains the required access key and stores it in a JSON format. This enables seamless and efficient communication between the microservice and the IGDB API. To ensure the proper functioning of my API, I aim to conduct thorough testing,
But how can we effectively test a microservice and select the right tools? 
This research aims to explore the most effective strategies and tools for testing my API.

## How to write a good test
***
When it comes to writing good tests there are some key principles to follow. One important aspect is to ensure readability, which greatly aids in debugging and maintaining the test suite over time.

One recommended approach is to use the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern, as suggested by Microsoft's unit testing best practices. This pattern involves structuring the test into three distinct phases:

  + Arrange: In this phase, you set up the necessary preconditions for the test. This includes initializing objects, configuring dependencies, and preparing the system under test to be in a specific state.

  + Act: The act phase is where you perform the specific action or operation that you want to test. This could be calling a method, invoking a function, or simulating user interactions. The focus is on triggering the behavior that you want to verify.

  + Assert: In the assert phase, you make assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code being tested. You compare the actual results or state of the system under test with the expected outcomes. If the assertions pass, the test is considered successful; otherwise, it indicates a failure.

By following the AAA pattern, you make the test structure clear and explicit, allowing for better comprehension of the test's purpose and flow. This pattern also helps in understanding the dependencies and interactions involved in the test, making it easier to identify and diagnose any issues that may arise.

In addition to the AAA pattern, other good practices for writing tests include keeping them fast, isolated, repeatable, and self-checking. These characteristics ensure that tests are reliable, provide quick feedback, and can be executed frequently without relying on external dependencies or producing inconsistent results.

## Different ways to test an API
***
When it comes to testing an API, there are several approaches available, but not all of them may be applicable or necessary for every project.
For my API I will explore three commen testing methodologies: unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

+ #### Unit testing
Unit testing is an essential practice in software development, where developers write code specifically designed to test individual functions or units of an application.
Unit testing can be performed manually or, more commonly, automated using a UnitTest framework. In the automated approach, developers write test code within the application, which can later be removed or commented out before deployment. [[2]](https://www.guru99.com/unit-testing-guide.html)

+ #### Intergration testing
Integration testing, also known as integration and testing (I&T), is a crucial phase in software testing where different modules or components of an application are tested as a combined entity. This testing approach focuses on verifying the interaction and interfaces between these modules, ensuring they work seamlessly when integrated. Integration testing involves combining the modules and evaluating their behavior as a cohesive unit. Integration testing helps identify errors in module integration, handle changing requirements, address common issues missed during unit testing, and ensure the smooth functioning of the entire application.

+ #### End to end testing

End-to-end testing is a vital component of the software development lifecycle that aims to validate the functionality and performance of an application in real-life scenarios. It involves testing the entire application from start to finish, simulating user interactions and replicating live settings to ensure that all sub-systems, including UI and API layers, external databases, networks, and third-party integrations, work harmoniously. The complexity of modern software applications necessitates thorough end-to-end testing to identify any failures or instabilities that could impact the overall product.

## Mocking
***
When it comes to testing an API, there are different methodologies available, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. These testing approaches ensure the reliability and functionality of the API. However, during testing, it is often necessary to create simulated objects that mimic real objects to maintain control over the code's behavior and prevent unintended consequences. This process is known as mocking. By creating mock objects, developers can imitate specific behaviors or simulate interactions without affecting the actual system or data. Mocking allows for more precise and controlled testing, verifying function calls, the number of times they occur, and the arguments passed to them. It not only prevents real-world changes during testing but also provides deeper insights into the inner workings of the code, leading to more effective and informed testing practices.[[5]](https://realpython.com/lessons/what-mocking/)

## Tools
***
When it comes to effectively testing an API, using the right tools can greatly enhance the testing process and provide valuable insights. For testing APIs written in JavaScript, there are several tools that can be beneficial:

   **Jest**

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that is widely used for unit testing. It provides a comprehensive set of features, including a powerful mocking library, assertion utilities, and built-in code coverage reporting. Jest is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a great choice for testing JavaScript APIs. It supports asynchronous testing and provides tools for testing asynchronous operations such as promises and async/await functions. With its robust ecosystem and extensive community support, Jest is a valuable tool for writing reliable and maintainable tests for JavaScript APIs.

   **Supertest**

Supertest is a module specifically designed for testing HTTP servers, making it an excellent choice for API testing. It allows you to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints and make assertions on the responses. Supertest simplifies the process of writing integration tests by providing a high-level API for making requests and inspecting responses. It integrates well with popular testing frameworks like Mocha and Jest, enabling you to seamlessly incorporate API testing into your existing test suite.

   **Postman**

Postman is a versatile tool that can be used for both manual and automated API testing. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests, inspecting responses, and validating API behavior. With Postman, you can easily create test scripts using JavaScript or other scripting languages to automate API testing. It supports various testing capabilities, including assertions, data-driven testing, and test result reporting. Postman also offers collaboration features, allowing teams to work together on API testing and share test collections.

   **Cypress**

While primarily known for end-to-end testing of web applications, Cypress can also be used effectively for API testing. Cypress provides a comprehensive testing framework with a rich set of APIs for interacting with APIs, making HTTP requests, and performing assertions. It offers a real-time reload feature that allows you to see test results instantly as you write your tests. Cypress's intuitive interface, powerful debugging tools, and seamless integration with JavaScript frameworks make it a valuable tool for testing both front-end and API functionalities.
