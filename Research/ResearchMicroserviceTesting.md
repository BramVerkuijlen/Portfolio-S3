## Introduction
***

As the demand for efficient and reliable APIs grows in the software development landscape, thorough testing becomes essential.
But how can we effectively test a microservice and select the right tools? 
This research aims to explore the most effective strategies and tools for testing my microservice.

## What does my API do?

My API is designed to provide a convenient and user-friendly way to search for games based on specific categories. By using the IGDB (Internet Game Database) API, you can request games belonging to various genres, platforms, or themes. The API acts as an intermediary, interacting with the IGDB API to retrieve relevant game data. Additionally the microservice retrieves the necessary access key and stores it in a JSON format. This allows for seamless and efficient communication between the microservice and the IGDB API.

## Different ways to test an API

When it comes to testing an API, there are several approaches available, but not all of them may be applicable or necessary for every project.
For my API I will explore three commen testing methodologies: unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

### Unit testing



### Intergration testing



### End to end testing
