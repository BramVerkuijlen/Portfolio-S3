## Reasons for Using an Existing Game Data API

As part of my project, I needed to gather a significant amount of game data. While I could have tried to collect this data manually, I quickly realized that this would be an extremely time-consuming and challenging task.

Using an existing API to collect game data made a lot of sense for several reasons. Firstly, it saved me a lot of time and effort. By tapping into an already established API, I didn't need to spend time developing custom data collection scripts or trying to reverse engineer game mechanics to gather data. Instead, I could quickly and easily retrieve the information I needed in a standardized format.

Additionally, using an existing game data API would most likely give me access to reliable and accurate data. Game data APIs are usually maintained and updated by the game developers themselves or other reliable sources, which means that the data provided is likely to be current and accurate.

## Steam API

Initially, I planned to use the Steam API, a platform developed by Valve for purchasing and playing games, for my research project. My decision to select the Steam API was based on my familiarity with the platform and the convenience of accessing user data via Steam's account system, including game libraries and friends lists.

However, during my research on the Steam API, I discovered that it did not offer the specific information I required for my project, namely detailed information about games. While the Steam API provides basic information about games such as their title and description, it does not offer more comprehensive information such as genre, rating, or multiplayer capabilities.

Therefore, I had to consider alternative data sources to obtain the necessary game-related information for my research project.
