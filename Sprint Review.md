## Sprint 1
***

### Recap
During this sprint, my primary focus was on doing research for my upcoming project and setting up my Git pages and personal portfolio. While I didn't complete any coding tasks during this sprint, I made significant progress in setting up my project environment and doing research for the front-end of my project.

During my research for my project, I took the time to review different frameworks and technologies that I could use. By doing this research, I was able to gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of each framework, which helped me decide to use Vue3 for my project.

I faced some challenges when planning my sprint. I had trouble with time estimates and task prioritization, which led to me having to rearrange my sprint plan several times. This was frustrating at first, but it ultimately helped me better understand how to plan for future sprints. I learned that it's important to break down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces and to be realistic about time estimates.
