# Retrospective Sprint 3
***

I: can you do a retrospective with me

ChatGTP: Of course! I'd be happy to do a retrospective with you. What specifically would you like to reflect on?

I: I just finished my third sprint. In this sprint I primarilly focused on Research for my project, I also made a simple API gateway and finished a task that I couldnt finish last sprint.

ChatGTP: Great! A retrospective is a good opportunity to reflect on what went well, what didn't go so well, and what you can do differently in the future. Let's start by looking at what went well during this sprint. What achievements are you most proud of?

I: I'm proud of the research I did this sprint and the amount of new things I learned in the last 2 weeks

ChatGTP: That's great to hear! Learning new things is always a valuable achievement. Can you give me some more specific details about the research you did and what you learned?

I: I did research on existing game apI's and on API Gateways. In the research I learned how to make and use API Gateways and the advantages of them and I got a better understanding of what the structure of my project is going to look like

ChatGTP: That's fantastic! It sounds like your research was very productive and informative. It's great that you were able to learn new skills and gain a better understanding of your project's structure.

Now, let's move on to the next part of the retrospective. What are some areas that you feel could have gone better during this sprint?

I: My sprint went overall really good, the only thing I think can be better is working out my tasks more before I start the sprint

ChatGTP: That's a good insight. Improving your task planning can definitely help make your sprints even more productive. Are there any specific changes you would like to make to your task planning process for the next sprint?

I: I would like to improve the acceptance criteria of the tasks and make them smaller if needs be

ChatGTP: Those are great ideas. Having clear and specific acceptance criteria can help ensure that you stay on track with your goals and that you're able to complete your tasks successfully. Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones can also help make the work feel more achievable and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.

Finally, let's wrap up the retrospective by thinking about what you can do differently in the future. Based on what you've learned this sprint, what are some changes you would like to make to your approach for the next sprint?

I: before i begin the sprint I want to work my tasks out better

ChatGTP: That's a great goal. Taking the time to plan your tasks thoroughly before starting the sprint can help set you up for success and make the work feel more manageable.

One technique you might find helpful is breaking down your tasks into smaller, more specific sub-tasks, and defining clear acceptance criteria for each sub-task. This can help you stay focused on what needs to be done and ensure that you're making progress towards your larger goals.

Another technique that can be helpful is prioritizing your tasks based on their importance and urgency. This can help you stay focused on the most critical tasks and avoid getting bogged down in less important work.

Overall, taking the time to plan your tasks and prioritize your work can help make your sprints more productive and enjoyable. Good luck with your next sprint!
