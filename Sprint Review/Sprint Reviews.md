## Sprint 1
***
During this sprint, my primary focus was on doing research for my upcoming project and setting up my Git pages and personal portfolio. While I didn't complete any coding tasks during this sprint, I made significant progress in setting up my project environment and doing research for the front-end of my project.

During my research for my project, I took the time to review different frameworks and technologies that I could use. By doing this research, I was able to gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of each framework, which helped me decide to use Vue3 for my project.

I faced some challenges when planning my sprint. I had trouble with time estimates and task prioritization, which led to me having to rearrange my sprint plan several times. This was frustrating at first, but it ultimately helped me better understand how to plan for future sprints. I learned that it's important to break down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces and to be realistic about time estimates.

## Sprint 2
***
During this sprint, my primary goal was to complete the main user story of advising games based on the user's current interests. I started by developing the front-end of the application, but I realized that the initial approach with a dropdown box for selecting categories was too rigid. Therefore, I pivoted to a free-form input field that gives users more control over their search.

Unfortunately, this change resulted in not being able to complete all of the planned user stories and tasks. However, I am satisfied with the progress made and the foundation laid for future development.

The change in approach also meant that I will need to refine other user stories that relied on specific categories. Therefore, the next sprint will focus on conducting research and refining the user stories to better accommodate this change.

Overall, I learned valuable lessons about flexibility and adaptability in the development process, and I will continue to refine my planning process to better accommodate future changes.

## Sprint 3
***

During my third sprint, I primarily focused on research for my project. I researched various options for APIs to retrieve game data, taking into account factors such as performance, reliability, and ease of use. I also researched what an API Gateway is and what it does, as well as different types of API Gateways that are available. I looked into existing API Gateways to gain a better understanding of their functionality and how they could potentially benefit our project.

In addition to my research, I also built a Kong API Gateway with basic functionality. Currently, the gateway has only one example endpoint, but this provides a starting point for us to build upon in future sprints. I plan to continue refining the gateway as our project progresses.

Finally, I was able to complete the Game Overview task that I was unable to finish during the previous sprint. That involved a Game Overview component for the adviced games.

This sprint was productive, and I did not experience any setbacks. However, I realized that I need to work on writing out my tasks better to optimize my productivity in future sprints. This includes setting more specific goals for each task and breaking them down into smaller, manageable subtasks.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the progress made during this sprint and feel confident that I am on track to deliver a high-quality project. I'm looking forward to continuing my work and refining my project in the next sprint.
